My mother died, and we were very sad, because we
loved her dearly. Elizabeth was brave and helped us; her
sweet smile gave us some happiness in the unhappy days
after my mother's death.
The time came for me to go to university. I did not
want to leave my sad family, but we all knew that I
should go. It was hard to leave, too, because the parents
of my good friend Henry Clerval would not let him go to
university with me. And so I had to go alone.
On my first day at the university I met my teacher,
Professor Waldman, who was one of the greatest
scientists in the world. He gave a wonderful talk to all the
students who were starting at the university. He ended his
talk by saying: 'Some of you will become the great
scientists of tomorrow. You must study hard and
discover everything that you can. That is why God made
_ you intelligent - to help other people.'
After the professor's talk, I thought very carefully. I
remembered the storm when I was fifteen. I remembered
how the lightning had destroyed the tree. I wanted to use
electricity to help people, and I wanted to discover the
secrets of life. I decided to work on these two things. I did
not know then that my work would destroy me and the
people that I loved.
